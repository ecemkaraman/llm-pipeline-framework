# 🚀 LLM Pipeline Framework: Reverse-Engineering Large Language Models

## 📌 Overview  
This repository **breaks down the LLM pipeline step by step**, helping you understand how AI models process, generate, and optimize text responses. Instead of seeing LLMs as a black box, this framework **reverse-engineers each component**, giving both **high-level intuition** and **technical deep dives**.  

## 📍 What’s Inside?  
🔹 **8-Step LLM Pipeline Breakdown**  
🔹 **Diagrams & Visuals for Each Step**  
🔹 **Code Snippets for Key Concepts**  
🔹 **References to Research Papers & Further Reading**  
🔹 **Discussion Threads for Community Q&A**

## 🔀 The 8-Step LLM Pipeline
Each step is structured as an independent module that explains **how a specific process works inside an LLM.**  

| **Step** | **What Happens Here?** | **Docs** |

| **1️⃣ Input Processing** | Tokenization, chat templates, and how the model interprets text. | [🔗 Read More](docs/1_input_processing.md) |
| **2️⃣ Neural Network (Core Processing)** | Embeddings, attention mechanisms, transformer layers. | [🔗 Read More](docs/2_neural_network.md) |
| **3️⃣ Output Processing** | Decoding strategies (greedy, top-k, beam search), temperature scaling. | [🔗 Read More](docs/3_output_processing.md) |
| **4️⃣ Training & Optimization** | Pretraining, fine-tuning, RLHF, loss functions, optimizers. | [🔗 Read More](docs/4_training.md) |
| **5️⃣ Memory & Context Handling** | Context windows, long-term memory, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). | [🔗 Read More](docs/5_memory_context.md) |
| **6️⃣ Customization & Inference** | Fine-tuning, LoRA, quantization, API deployment. | [🔗 Read More](docs/6_customization_inference.md) |
